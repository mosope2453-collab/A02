Install Git on your local machine by following the instructions provided on the official website: Installing Git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

**How to Configure Git**
Git offers a variety of configurations that can streamline your workflow. In this section, I will guide you through the process of setting up Git on your local machine. Let's get started.

Configuring your name and email address on your local machine is an essential step in setting up Git. These details are attached to each commit you make, providing context and ownership. Let's learn how to use the git config --global command to set your name and email globally on your local machine.

**How to Set the Default Editor**
In modern development, having a code editor can significantly simplify your workflow, especially when you're focused on coding.

**How to Create a Repository Using the Github Website**
Creating a repository is the first step in using Git. A repository is a storage location where your projects live, containing all the files and revision history.

In this section, I will guide you through the process of creating a repository on GitHub.

There are two ways to create a repository: using the GitHub website or the command line. Let's get started. In this section, we'll focus on creating a repository using the GitHub website and the command line.

**Part 2**
**Branch:** A version of the codebase that diverges from the main branch to isolate changes for specific features, fixes, or experiments.
**Clone:** The act of downloading a repository from a remote source to your local machine.
**Commit:** A snapshot of your changes, saved to your local repository. Each commit is uniquely identified by a checksum.
**Fetch:** The action of retrieving updates from a remote repository without merging them into your current branch.
**GIT:** Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system. It's designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency
**Github:** GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
**Merge:** The process of integrating changes from one branch into another, typically the main branch.
Merge Conflict: 
**Push:** The action of sending your commits to a remote repository.
**Pull:** The action of fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your current branch.
**Remote:** A common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
**Repository:** A storage location where your project lives, containing all the files and revision history.
